 * Name: Bill Mao

 * Date: 11/28/2017
 *
 * School: East Chapel Hill High School
 *
 * Program: Program 500c (foolinâ€™ around with strings)
 *
 * Description: This program is designed to print a word specified by the user x times, where is x the number of characters (length) of the word.
 * The program first initializes any variables needed later in the program for clarity purposes, and then asks the user for the word to be printed.
 * The program then finds the length of the word using the .length method.
 * A empty line is then printed for formatting purposes, and the length of the word is assigned to a different variable...
 * so that the original value can be kept.
 * A while loop then prints the word the requisite number of times.
 * The program then finally prints out the number of times the work was printed, and terminates.
 *
 * Difficulties: I originally did not use the timesPrinted variable, as I did not take into account the original amount of characters...
 * in the word needed to be saved in order to print the amount of times the word was printed.
 *
 * What I Learned: I got some more practice with loops and the .length method for the String class.
