/**
 * Name: Bill Mao
 * Date: 9/7/2017
 * School: East Chapel Hill High School
 * Program: prog2a Prgram
 * Description: This program prints a statement describing Java and how you must treat it very carefully.
 * It includes line breaks, and it was changed from a statement that described C++.
 * Difficulties: I first typed all the line breaks with regular slashes, but once I compiled, I noticed this mistake and changed them all to backslashes.
 * What I Learned: I learned how to use escape characters in Java, and how to add line breaks to text strings.
