 *
 * Program: Program 215c (donâ€™t fence me in)
 *
 * Description: This program is designed to calculate the maximum area of fence possible with 100 yards of fencing.
 * The program first begins by initializing four variable that will be used to find the maximum area possible.
 * A for loop then executes that checks for areas with a fence length of 1-49 yards
 * In the loop, the width and then  area are calculated first.
 * In an if statement, the area is then compared to the previous area, and if the previous area is larger than the current area, it indicates that the maximum area has been reached.
 * The previous area and its dimensions are then printed for the user to see.
 * The if statement then breaks and the loop ends.
 *
 * Difficulties: I originally did not include a break in the if statement, as I expected multiple fence dimensions to give me the maximum height.
 * I then implemented the break after seeing that only one answer gives the maximum height and any other values are incorrect.
 *
 * What I Learned: I got some more practice with loops, the if statement, and the break statement in Java.

//Output:
//With 100 yards of fencing material:
