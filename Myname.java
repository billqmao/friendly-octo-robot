/**
 * Name: Bill Mao
 * Date: 9/7/2017
 * School: East Chapel Hill High School
 * Program: Prog3a Program
 * Description: This program prints an ascii art version of my first name, Bill.
 * It accomplishes this by using a println function for each line of text that needs to be printed.
 * Difficulties: I originally intended to do this project usinng line breaks, but I swtiched to multiple print functions.
 * This is because it is much easier to visualise how the characters would look with multiple print functions,
 * and it would be easier to change and maintain.
 * What I Learned: I learned how to format and space characters in the println function.
